      <description>Running an open source project taught me more about software design and communication than any job I've had. You have to think about every decision from the perspective of a stranger reading your code. - Software Engineer Tai Groot on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast</description>

      <description>We just published a full-length interactive book by computer science professor and freeCodeCamp contributor Dr. Mark Mahoney. It will teach you the foundations of both back end and front end web development. You'll learn some Node, Express, SQLite, GraphQL, Web Components, React, and more. Mark even built his own open source &quot;code playback&quot; system to walk you through the book's code step-by-step with detailed explanations. Pretty cool.</description>

      <description>On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview Back End engineer Tai Groot about Go, TypeScript, and Rust. We dive into the Developer Experience VS Performance tradeoffs of each of these programming languages. One piece of advice Tai shares: Rust is a superb language for rewriting an older codebase... but never use it to write your first version of something new. He also shares tips for running open source projects, and for senior engineers who want to mentor new devs who are entering the field.</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp just published a new handbook on how to build your own custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. The entire MCP paradigm was just invented 7 months ago, so let me explain how it works. Before MCP, you needed to write custom connector code for each data source your LLM used -- such as calendars, map APIs, and sensor data streams. Sure -- tools like LangChain helped with this. But MCP makes things so much simpler. You just lay out how your data is structured. That way when an LLM connects, it can figure out how to get whatever data it needs all on its own. This MCP approach is an excellent complement to the Retrieval Augmented Generation technique developers were using last year.</description>

      <description>On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I interview modern-day renaissance man Vaughn Gene. After struggling with high school, Vaughn joined the US Navy and spent 10 years in Japan. He became fluent in the Japanese language and worked as a personal trainer for locals. He wanted more flexibility in his work, so he used freeCodeCamp to learn to code, then started lining up freelance clients. Along the way, Vaughn has also taught himself guitar, piano, Spanish, and advanced Mixed Martial Arts techniques. He shares his self-teaching heuristics, and how he's able to cultivate so many skills in tandem. I loved learning from him, and I think you will, too.</description>

      <description>I was in my early thirties, and I never thought about coding in the sense that I could do it. Of course, I always found coding cool. I always thought it's cool when I see it in the movies, like, 'How can people be so smart and program this?' But not me. I mean, I'm old. I'm a woman. Never, ever. But my younger brother told me, 'You still have to work at least 30 to 40 years. You can still do everything you want.' - Julia Undeutsch, Software Engineer, Accessibility expert, and freeCodeCamp alumna</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp also just published a full-length book on how to design your own Microservices and deploy them to the cloud. Microservice Architecture is a software development approach where you build stand-alone apps that only do one specific thing. Then these Microservices call upon one another to get more complicated things done. This differs from the traditional Monolith approach, where everything's part of the same codebase. This intermediate book will teach you about Synchronous versus Async Communication, RESTful APIs, Protocol Buffers, Container Orchestration, CI/CD Pipelines, and more. It also features case studies from companies that have adopted Microservices, such as Amazon and Netflix.</description>

John's also the creator of one of the most popular open source projects of all time: Coding Interview University. This is John's first-ever appearance on a podcast, so we go really in-depth. We talk about his years working as an interpreter in the US military. Then we dive into how he taught himself software engineering, and what he's learned from climbing the ranks at a big tech company. If you're learning to code later in life, this should be particularly helpful for you.</description>

      <description>If you already know a little JavaScript and want to learn Python, too, this handbook is for you. It will turbo-charge your learning by teaching you the similarities between these two high level scripting languages. You'll learn how each language approaches Syntax, Data Structures, Modules, Error Handling, and more. You'll even get some side-by-side script comparisons so that you can appreciate the nuanced differences in how these languages get things done. My humble advice is to learn both of these languages, and to learn them well. They will only become more and more central to software development over the next 20 years.</description>

      <description>When you run a popular app, you probably don't want to deploy new features to all of your users at the same time. You instead want to test those features out with a small subset of your users. That's where Feature Flags come in handy. This tutorial will teach you how to add Feature Flags to a Golang app, so that you can more safely roll out new code.</description>

      <description>This week, the freeCodeCamp community turns 10 years old. Back in 2014, I sat down and wrote the first lines of the freeCodeCamp open source codebase. Since then, we've built an interactive 3,000-hour core curriculum that teaches math, programming, and computer science. We've also built a library of more than 12,000 programming tutorials and more than 1,000 full-length YouTube courses. And most importantly, we've brought together a supportive community of developers who are eager to help people expand their skills. In this brief article and update video, you'll learn about the path ahead, along with some major improvements we're making to freeCodeCamp's core curriculum.</description>

      <description>This week's freeCodeCamp podcast is one of the best interviews I've ever done. Dorian had a rough upbringing in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. As a kid, he dropped out of high school and got arrested 4 times for crimes like stealing cars. His mother had to get him out of there, and his parole officer agreed to let him move to Las Vegas. There he found stable jobs parking cars at casinos. He taught himself how to code using freeCodeCamp, and eventually got software engineering jobs at Fortune 500 companies. I hope you enjoy this whirlwind of an interview.</description>

      <description>Learn how to leverage the powerful Binary Exponentiation Algorithm to calculate large powers of numbers. Developers use this all the time when working on cryptography and computer graphics. The reason Binary Exponentiation is so powerful is that it reduces the amount of multiplications you need to do, and each iteration through the loop re-uses previous calculations. This tutorial will show you how to implement this algorithm step-by-step with a simple Python script, and understand what's happening under the hood.</description>

      <description>On this week's freeCodeCamp podcast, I talk with Dennis Ivy about how to become a street-smart developer. Dennis grew up in an immigrant family with 13 kids, and dropped out of school to work in construction. He taught himself to code while working as a janitor at a church. Then he started building websites for local plumbers. He eventually built a software system that he was able to sell to his employer, kicking off a career of entrepreneurship and freelance development. Dennis has tons of practical tips for building your network and finding clients. I had a blast hearing what he had to say. And I think you will, too.</description>

      <description>Fact of the Week: Even though NVIDIA created the first modern GPU, the term &quot;GPU&quot; has been associated with stand-alone graphics chips since the 1970s, when it stood for &quot;Graphics Processor Unit&quot;. Sony then popularized the term in 1994 when they marketed the Playstation's &quot;Geometry Processing Unit&quot;, a Geometry Transformation Engine paired with a 2D co-processor. Finally in 1999, NVIDIA introduced the GeForce 256 &quot;Graphics Processing Unit&quot;, leading to modern GPUs like the one that's in the device that you're reading this Fact of the Week on right now.</description>

      <description>This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Hiroko Nishimura, who had a brain tumor removed when she was just 22 years old. At the time, the doctors told her she'd never be able to live independently again. But she learned how to walk again and talk again. And eventually she learned a ton about Systems Administration and Cloud Engineering. Today, more than 500,000 students have learned these developer concepts from her. We talk about Hiroko's entire life -- from learning English as an immigrant from Japan, to getting her first job in tech, to becoming a prolific teacher.</description>

      <description>Developers often build small chunks of reusable code called Components. And at some point it makes sense to pull these together into a full-blown Component Library. This tutorial will give you a solid understanding of what Component Libraries are, their history, and how they differ from Design Systems. You'll learn how to wield the power of Component Libraries for yourself, so you can avoid rewriting code that other devs have written so many times before, and instead focus on the novel work to be done.</description>

      <description>Did you know that Babe Ruth -- the most famous home-run-hitting baseball player of all time -- was blind in one eye? He made up for this by being extremely good at predictive analytics -- honing his instincts for what type of pitch is coming across home plate. I learned this during my insight-filled conversation with Ken Jee. He's a golfer turned data scientist who works closely with professional athletes. During my podcast interview, Ken shares a ton of tips for folks interested in getting into data science and machine learning, and for athletes who want to gain a quantitative edge on their competitors.</description>

      <description>Andrew Brown is a CTO who has passed dozens of cloud certification exams over the years. And he's back with an in-depth guide to the popular AWS SysOps certification exam. This course will not only teach you everything tested on the exam -- it will also ground you in cloud engineering concepts. So what is SysOps? Well, it's like a traditional SysAdmin (System Administrator) role that pretty much every company has -- but for cloud servers. This freeCodeCamp course will cover Networking, Logging, Metrics, Events, Security, Load Balancing, Serverless Architecture, and more. If you want to take the plunge and learn all these skills, this course has got you covered.</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp just published a TypeScript for beginners course to help you learn the art of statically-typed JavaScript. Most scripting languages like JavaScript and Python are dynamically-typed. But this causes so many additional coding errors. By sticking with static types -- like Java and C++ do -- JavaScript developers can save themselves a lot of debugging. Instructor and software engineer Bob Ziroll will teach you TypeScript fundamentals like Literal Types, Unions, Generics, and more.</description>

      <description>&quot;The Swiss Army Knife is kind of bad at everything. But it's got a real good general sense, and it will help you survive.

      <description>Optimistic UI is a new User Interface Design approach that gets its name from its blind optimism. Instead of waiting for confirmation from the server, an Optimistic UI front-end assumes everything will turn out OK, and immediately updates itself to reflect user input. This reduces perceived latency and simplifies complex UI interactions like dragging and dropping. This tutorial by developer Jaja David will teach you key concepts like Stale-While-Revalidate and Optimistic CRUD. It will also explore the drawbacks of this happy-go-lucky approach.</description>

      <description>When I make characters, I try to design them in a way that teaches players how to play the game. In other words, if an enemy looks too pretty, they won't seem like an enemy to the player. But if you give them an enemy-like appearance, then the player won't need to read the manual or anything to know: ‘oh, I've got to avoid this guy.' - Gunpei Yokoi, who helped develop the original 1986 Metroid game that spawned the Metroidvania game genre</description>

      <description>My hero Dr. Chuck created this comprehensive C programming course and shared it with the global freeCodeCamp community. Dr. Chuck is a University of Michigan computer science professor, and he is a hardcore advocate for everyone learning C. Not only will this course help you understand computer architecture and low-level programming. It will also teach you Object-Oriented Programming concepts. This course even includes an interview with the creator of Python, Guido van Rossum. As you may know, Python -- like most modern programming languages -- is built on top of C.</description>

      <description>On this week's podcast, I interview software engineer Jerod Santo, who hosts the longest-running podcast on open source, The Changelog. We talk about his life as a remote dev in Omaha, Nebraska, where he's raising his 6 kids. We also talk about the new Changelog News podcast with its weekly 10-minute updates on the world of open source. He shares his process for researching and surfacing interesting developments. And he also talks about emerging trends in open source, such as the controversial relicensing of Terraform. I had a blast learning from Jerod and I think you will, too.</description>

      <description>Andrew Brown is a CTO who has passed dozens of cloud certification exams over the years. And he's back with an updated guide to the popular AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate exam. This course will not only teach you everything tested on the exam -- it will also ground you in cloud engineering fundamentals. And no, that's not a typo. This really is a 50 hour course. But as opera singer Beverly Sills once said, there are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going.</description>

      <description>Two of the most important tools in any data scientist's toolbox are Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. This tutorial by data scientist Olu Samuel Praise will teach you how to apply each of these techniques for analyzing data and making predictions. In short, Logistic Regression will give you a binary classification of data: is this picture of a hot dog -- yes or no? And Linear Regression will give you a continuous value like a percentage. For example, predicting exam scores from students based on their attendance and hours studied. Again, both approaches are super useful and I think you'll learn a lot from this quick read.</description>

      <description>Calculus is fundamentally naive. Almost childish in its optimism. Experience teaches us that change can be sudden, discontinuous, and wrenching. Calculus draws its power by refusing to see that. It insists on a world without accidents, where one thing leads logically to another. Give me the initial conditions and the law of motion, and with calculus I can predict the future - or better yet, reconstruct the past. - Steven H.

      <description>In Machine Learning, Fine-Tuning is the process of taking a model that you've already trained (or a foundation model like Llama) and enhancing it with your own datasets. For example, you could take a Large Language Model and make it much better at chess by fine-tuning it by feeding it thousands of famous chess games. This course will first teach you about Quantization, a technique to optimize models for efficiency. Then you'll learn modern methods of fine-tuning like LORA and QLORA. Next you'll delve into Gradient-based optimization methods. Finally you'll learn how to build AI pipelines and how to fine-tune models using your own datasets.</description>

      <description>Quantum Computing is real. Engineers are already finding ways to apply it to Cryptography, Drug Discovery, AI, and other fields. You can be the first of your friends to understand and appreciate how Quantum Computing works. The first half of this course focuses on the math behind quantum computing algorithms. You'll learn about Complex Numbers and Linear Algebra. Then you'll learn concepts like Qubits -- Quantum Bits -- along with Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Circuits, and Phase Kickback. Even though this course is designed for newcomers to Quantum Computing, I'm not going to downplay the importance of math skills in understanding this course. Fortunately, if you want to improve your math skills, freeCodeCamp also has a ton of university-level math courses to help get you there.</description>

I ask him tons of questions about what it takes to become a professional designer in 2024. And we learn all about his own coding journey.

Most scripting languages like JavaScript and Python are dynamically-typed. But this causes so many additional coding errors. By sticking with static types -- like Java and C++ do -- JavaScript developers can save so much headache. This beginner course is taught by legendary coding instructor John Smilga. I love his no-nonsense teaching style and the way he makes even advanced concepts easier to understand. And you can apply what you're learning by coding along at home and building your own ecommerce platform project in TypeScript.</description>

One approach is by using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will teach you how to leverage Diffie-Hellman to protect your data in transit, as it moves from between clients and servers. This handbook dives deep into the math that makes this possible, and uses tons of diagrams to explain the theory. It also explores older solutions, such as Hash-based Message Authentication Code. And you'll immediately put all this new knowledge to use by building a secure messaging project.</description>

      <description>Generative AI is a type of Artificial Intelligence that creates new content based on its training data, rather than just returning a pre-programmed response. You may have tried creating text or images using models like GPT-4, Gemini, or the open source Llama 2. But how do these models actually work? This in-depth freeCodeCamp course will teach you the underlying Machine Learning concepts that you can use to create your own models. And it'll show you how to leverage popular tools like Langchain, Vector Databases, Hugging Face, and more.</description>

      <description>On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Jessica Wilkins, an orchestral musician from Los Angeles turned software engineer. We talk about how ridiculously competitive the world of classical music is, and how it gave her the mental toughness that she needed to learn to code. Jessica ultimately turned down contracts from Disney and other music industry titans so that she could focus on transitioning into tech. She was a prolific volunteer contributor to the freeCodeCamp codebase and core curriculum, and now works on our team. I think you'll dig our conversation -- especially if you're interested in the overlap between music and technology.</description>

      <description>This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Beau Carnes, who oversees the freeCodeCamp community YouTube channel. Over the past 5 years, Beau has taught dozens of coding tutorials and helped curate more than 1,000 courses. We talk about his transition from high school special education teacher to software engineer. He shares the story of how he earned his second degree in just 6 months while raising 3 kids and running a stilt-walking service. This is my first video podcast, so you can actually watch me and Beau talk while you listen. Or you can just listen the old-fashioned way in your browser or podcast app of choice.</description>

      <description>For years, people have asked for an in-depth course on Data Engineering. And I'm thrilled to say freeCodeCamp just published one, and it's a banger. Data Engineers design systems to collect, store, and analyze data -- systems that Data Scientists and Data Analysts rely on. This course will teach you key concepts like Data Pipelines and ETL (Extract-Transform-Load). And you'll learn how to use tools like Docker, CRON, and Apache Airflow.</description>

NGINX uses an asynchronous, event-driven architecture so you can handle a ton of concurrent users with fewer servers. We just published a crash course on using NGINX for back-end development. You'll learn how to use it for load balancing, reverse proxying, data streaming, and even as a Microservice Architecture.</description>

      <description>You may have heard the term &quot;ACID database&quot;. It refers to a database that guarantees transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. MySQL and PostgreSQL are fully ACID-compliant. Other databases like MongoDB and Cassandra have partial ACID guarantees. So what are these properties and why are they so important? This article by Daniel Adetunji will explain everything using helpful analogies and some of his own artwork.</description>

      <description>This week freeCodeCamp published a massive book on Git. Git was invented by the same programmer who created Linux. It's a powerful Version Control System that virtually all new software projects use. This said, even experienced developers can struggle to understand Git. So my friend Omer Rosenbaum -- the CTO of an AI company -- wrote this intermediate book. It will teach you how Git works under the hood, and how you can use it to collaborate with other devs around the world.</description>

      <description>A String is one of the most primordial of data types. You can find String variables in almost every programming language. Strings are just a sequence of characters, usually between two quote marks, like this: &quot;banana&quot;. And yet there are so many things you can do with Strings: Concatenation, Comparison, Encoding, and even String Searching with Regular Expressions. Joan Ayebola wrote this in-depth handbook that will teach you everything you need to know about JavaScript Strings.</description>

      <description>Joke of the Week: *&quot;Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Dec 25 = Oct 31.&quot;* In programming, Dec stands for Decimal, meaning a base-10 number system. And Oct stands for Octal, meaning a base-8 number system. So Dec 25 really does equal Oct 31. I know – this isn't the funniest programmer joke ever, but it is fun to think about.</description>

      <description>There's a way to represent images with code, and I use it all the time. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and it's one of the most efficient ways to store images for icons or other simple patterns. It's so efficient because it stores the literal coordinates of all the lines and colors of your image. In this tutorial, freeCodeCamp contributor Hunor Márton Borbély will teach you how to work with SVG files by coding your own Christmas tree, gingerbread man, and snowflake art.</description>

      <description>Developers sometimes encode data as raw text using Base64, even though it takes up 33% more storage than binary. Why do they do this? Well, Base64 is just a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and two symbols: + and /. Just to check my math, that's 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64 characters, right? This tutorial will teach you all the things you never knew you wanted to know about Base64. And it will solve the mystery of why developers continue to use this even today.</description>

So they gave an invisible guy a train-shaped-sized hat instead, and made him run the tracks. That's the spirit. - Front End Developer freezydorito on Twitter (And yes, that is really how Fallout 3's trains work)</description>

You'll learn about vector embeddings and how you can use them on top of GPT-4 and other Large Language Models. This way you can code your own AI assistant with output customized by you. For example, you can throw all 11,000 tutorials freeCodeCamp has published into a database, embed them, and then your AI assistant can retrieve relevant tutorials when you ask it a question. This may sound pretty advanced, but modern tools make this a lot easier. You'll learn how to use OpenAI's GPT-4 API, LangChain, data from Hugging Face, and age-old Natural Language Processing techniques.</description>

      <description>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complicated problems by breaking them down into smaller bits. You then store the solutions to these sub-problems in a table, where they can be more efficiently accessed, so the computer doesn't need to recalculate them each time. This efficient DP approach comes up all the time in Algorithms &amp; Data Structure coding interview questions. And this freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to ace those questions. We teach DP using Java. But if you know Python, C++, or JavaScript, you may be able to follow along as well.</description>

      <description>The first time I used ChatGPT, I was impressed. But I didn't yet realize how useful it would become in my day-to-day work as a developer. Only after I learned some Prompt Engineering techniques did I get good at communicating with the AI. Now I'm much more effective at getting Large Language Models to do tasks for me. That's why I'm excited to share this new freeCodeCamp course on Prompt Engineering. Ania Kubów will teach you techniques like Few-Shot Prompting, Vectors, Embeddings, and how to reduce AI hallucinations.</description>

      <description>I'm going to attempt to explain 3 types of cloud storage in this single paragraph. Block Storage is like a book shelf that can hold a set number of pages -- say 100. A 200 page book would take up 2 shelves. File Storage then adds abstractions on top of that, such as directories and hierarchy. Finally, Object Storage is the newest, most durable approach. It just uses flat files. And I'm just scratching the surface here. You should totally read more in Daniel's thoughtful tutorial.</description>

      <description>TypeScript is a popular version of JavaScript that uses static types. This means that for each variable in your code, you specify whether it's a string, array, integer, or other data type. Why bother with this? Because it will dramatically reduce the number of bugs in your codebase. freeCodeCamp moved to TypeScript a few years ago, and we haven't looked back. If you know some basic JavaScript, you can quickly learn TypeScript and start reaping the benefits. This full-length handbook will teach you how to use React with TypeScript. You can code along at home and build your own type-safe To Do List app.</description>

      <description>C is the most widely-used programming language in the world. Even when you're coding in Python or JavaScript, you're still using C under the hood. One key reason why C is still so popular 50 years after its creation is its high performance. C directly interacts with computer hardware. One way it does this is through Pointers, which point to the location of data in the computer's physical memory. In this beginner's freeCodeCamp course on C programming, you'll learn about Pointers and key concepts like Passing By Reference, Passing By Value, Void Pointers, Arrays, and more.</description>

      <description>Python is a truly wonderful language. When somebody comes up with a good idea, it takes about 1 minute and five lines to program something that almost does what you want. Then it takes only an hour to extend the script to 300 lines, after which it still does almost what you want. - Jack Jansen, Scientific Programmer and Software Engineer</description>

      <description>There's not a public API for everything. Sometimes developers have to resort to scraping. Scraping is a technique where you extract data directly from a webpage. And Python makes scraping so much easier. This course will teach you how to code your own Scrapy spider to crawl websites. Then you'll learn how to clean your data, build pipelines, and ultimately automate the entire process in the cloud.</description>

      <description>Remember those silly BuzzFeed personality quizzes? Like: &quot;What type of cheese are you?&quot; This course will teach you how to code your own BuzzFeed-style website using 3 different approaches: a vanilla JavaScript app, a React + JSON API app, and finally a TypeScript + Node.js mini-backend. This course is taught by long-time developer and freeCodeCamp instructor Ania Kubów. If you code along at home, I think you'll learn a ton from this course, and have a lot of fun along the way.</description>

      <description>In my years as a developer, I've found that people greatly underestimate how powerful spreadsheets are for doing data analysis. You don't need to be a statistician to squeeze out meaningful insights from your spreadsheet. One of the most helpful spreadsheet functions is LOOKUP, and its descendants VLOOKUP, HLOOKUP, and XLOOKUP. This in-depth tutorial will show you how to wield these powerful functions to slice and dice data just the way you need it.</description>

But I know many developers who swear up and down that this is worth the time investment. If you want to take the plunge, this Vim Beginner's Guide is a great starting point.</description>

      <description>I started freeCodeCamp back in 2014. Since then, a ton of people have asked for my advice on how to learn to code and ultimately get freelance clients and developer jobs. So last year, I wrote an entire book summarizing my many tips. Even though one of the Big 5 book publishers in New York was interested in a book deal, I decided to instead make this book freely available to everyone who wants to become a professional developer. I hope it's helpful for you and your friends who are getting into coding.</description>

      <description>The ‘joy of discovery' is one of the fundamental joys of play itself. Not just the joy of discovering secrets within the game, but also the joy of uncovering the creator's vision. It's that ‘Aha!' moment where it all makes sense, and behind the world the player can feel the touch of another creative mind. In order for it to be truly joyful, however, it must remain hidden from plain view-not carved as commandments into stone tablets but revealed, piece by piece, through the player's exploration of the game's rules. - Derek Yu, game developer and creator of Spelunky</description>

      <description>TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript.</description>

      <description>User Interface VS User Experience -- what's the difference, you might ask? Well, User Interfaces have been around since the industrial revolution. Think the control room of a power station, or the cockpit of a plane. But User Experience -- that's a more recent way of thinking about Human-Computer Interaction. The term was coined in the 1990s by a designer and cognitive psychologist at Apple. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp instructor Dionysia Lemonaki will explain the distinctions between the two and their shared history. She'll also walk you through the UX Design Process.</description>

      <description>What's the difference between Authentication and Authorization? These two concepts are related, but there's a bit of nuance. Authentication is the process of verifying your credentials, and that you're allowed to access a system. Authorization involves verifying what you're allowed to do within that system. This tutorial will help you better understand these security concepts so you can apply them as a developer.</description>

      <description>CSS is a programming language. As unintuitive as it might feel to you at times, it's not just these random things that happen. It's built using very specific rules. The problem is that most people never learn those rules. We start learning CSS by learning the syntax, which is super simple. That tricks us into thinking that it's a simple language. Don't let the simple syntax trick you. Dive into it and learn how it works. - Kevin Powell, Software Engineer, CSS Educator, and freeCodeCamp contributor</description>

      <description>Have you ever seen a number followed by an exclamation point? In math, this is called a factorial. 5! is the number 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120. In programming, if an algorithm has n! time complexity, it means it will be extremely slow and inefficient. Thankfully, you can almost always avoid this through more thoughtful programming. This quick tutorial will teach you a bit more about factorials, with some beginner JavaScript exercises for how you can calculate them.</description>

The exact mechanisms can be abstracted away from the user interface (the brake pedal).</description>

      <description>Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the &quot;locally optimal&quot; solution at each stage of problem solving -- regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward -- never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum -- the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide &amp; Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them.</description>

      <description>The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove' to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample. This delay imparts a very ‘lazy', dragging feel on any beat using the bass drum - and the lower the pitch the greater the drag. - A fun fact from the music production-focused Attack Magazine</description>

      <description>Ugly programs are like ugly suspension bridges: they're much more liable to collapse than pretty ones, because the way humans (especially engineer-humans) perceive beauty is intimately related to our ability to process and understand complexity. A language that makes it hard to write elegant code makes it hard to write good code. - Eric S.

      <description>Fact of the Week: During the production of the movie Toy Story 2, an unnamed Pixar employee was doing some routine data cleanup. They wanted to delete some of their files. So they typed this into their command line: bin/rm -r -f \*. But they didn't realize that they were running the command inside the server's root folder. Animators knew something was wrong when the files they were working on started vanishing. They rushed over and unplugged the computer. But it was too late. 90% of the Toy Story 2's files had been deleted. The team was going to have to completely restart the $100,000,000 project. Luckily, one of their animators was working from home after having a baby. She had a 2-week old backup of the data sitting on her desk. After she carefully drove her computer to the office, they were able to restore the database.</description>

      <description>Every year developers hold a competition to build video games using just 13 kilobytes of JavaScript. For reference, the original Donkey Kong game from 1981 was 16 kilobytes. And yet these devs are able to build platformers, puzzle games, and even 3D games in just 13KB. In this video, Ania will demo the top 20 games from this year's js13k competition, and she'll explain some of the techniques developers used to code these games.</description>

      <description>When you visit a website like freeCodeCamp.org, your computer starts sending packets of data back and forth across the internet using the Internet Protocol. The IPv4 protocol came out way back in 1980, and gives every server its own 4-byte address. (That's 4 numbers between 0 and 255. For example, the localhost address: 127.0.0.1). But this only results in 4.3 billion possible combinations. And websites are already using almost all of these. Thankfully, the newer IPv6 protocol can save humanity from the threat of &quot;address exhaustion&quot;. This article will show you how IPv6 works.</description>

      <description>An individual block of code takes moments to write, minutes to debug, and can last forever without being touched again. It's only when you visit code written yesterday that having code written in a clear, consistent style becomes extremely useful. Understandable code frees up your mental bandwidth from having to puzzle out inconsistencies, making it easier to maintain and enhance projects of all sizes. - Daniel Roy Greenfeld, Python Django developer and author</description>

      <description>You may have heard the term &quot;serverless&quot;. Technically, serverless computing does involve servers, but not your own servers. Instead, you just borrow a few cycles on a cluster of somebody else's servers. And one of the easiest ways to get started with serverless is to add a simple AWS Lambda function to your website. This tutorial will show you how to do this by creating a serverless &quot;contact us&quot; form.</description>

      <description>Programming is the only job I can think of where I get to be both an engineer and an artist. There's an incredible, rigorous, technical element to it, which I like because you have to do very precise thinking. On the other hand, it has a wildly creative side where the boundaries of imagination are the only real limitation. - Andy Hertzfeld</description>
