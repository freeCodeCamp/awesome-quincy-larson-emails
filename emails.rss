      <description>I always thought that software development was like rocket science. You had to be super smart for that kind of thing. But of course, one day I just went to Google and did a quick search and found Python. I could write a little script, and it would do these things for me. And it shaved an hour off my day every day. And that's what hooked me on software development. - Jesse Hall, self-taught software engineer and guest on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp also published a full-length handbook that will teach you the fundamentals of web accessibility. This way you'll be able to make your projects more usable by people who are living with disabilities. You'll learn about Semantic HTML and ARIA attributes. You'll then learn how to apply these tools to help people who have color blindness, or even full blindness. You'll also learn how to make your sites more accessible to people who navigate with a keyboard or a voice interface rather than a mouse. As I like to say, good accessibility is just good usability for everybody.</description>

      <description>If I was going to start learning programming from zero, where I had zero context, I'd learn IT fundamentals: how networking works, how the internet works, DNS, how packets transfer data, how computers communicate with each other. Because at the end of the day, all these servers in the cloud use networking to talk to each other. The second skill I'd spend my time on is learning how Linux works. - Rishab Kumar, software engineer and my guest on this week's freeCodeCamp podcast</description>

      <description>On this week's podcast, I interview software engineer James Q. Quick about how he approached his job search after a recent layoff. James grew up in Memphis and was an athlete who also played violin. He knew nothing about computer science, but chose it as his college major. Since then, he's not only worked as a dev at Microsoft, FedEx, and many tech startups. He's also given more than 100 talks at developer conferences. He talks about how his Harry Potter Trivia app helped launch his career. And he shares tons of advice for how to make a name for yourself through writing tutorials and giving conference talks.</description>

      <description>People who discover the power and beauty of high-level, abstract ideas often make the mistake of believing that concrete ideas at lower levels are worthless and might as well be forgotten. On the contrary, the best computer scientists are thoroughly grounded in basic concepts of how computers actually work. The essence of computer science is an ability to understand many levels of abstraction simultaneously. - Donald Knuth, programmer and mathematician</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp also just published a full-length book on how to design your own Microservices and deploy them to the cloud. Microservice Architecture is a software development approach where you build stand-alone apps that only do one specific thing. Then these Microservices call upon one another to get more complicated things done. This differs from the traditional Monolith approach, where everything's part of the same codebase. This intermediate book will teach you about Synchronous versus Async Communication, RESTful APIs, Protocol Buffers, Container Orchestration, CI/CD Pipelines, and more. It also features case studies from companies that have adopted Microservices, such as Amazon and Netflix.</description>

      <description>One of my favorite podcast interviews I've done was with John Washam, a software engineer at Amazon. John's also the creator of one of the most popular open source projects of all time: Coding Interview University. This is John's first-ever appearance on a podcast, so we go really in-depth. We talk about his years working as an interpreter in the US military. Then we dive into how he taught himself software engineering, and what he's learned from climbing the ranks at a big tech company. If you're learning to code later in life, this should be particularly helpful for you.</description>

      <description>If you already know a little JavaScript and want to learn Python, too, this handbook is for you. It will turbo-charge your learning by teaching you the similarities between these two high level scripting languages. You'll learn how each language approaches Syntax, Data Structures, Modules, Error Handling, and more. You'll even get some side-by-side script comparisons so that you can appreciate the nuanced differences in how these languages get things done. My humble advice is to learn both of these languages, and to learn them well. They will only become more and more central to software development over the next 20 years.</description>

      <description>This week, the freeCodeCamp community turns 10 years old. Back in 2014, I sat down and wrote the first lines of the freeCodeCamp open source codebase. Since then, we've built an interactive 3,000-hour core curriculum that teaches math, programming, and computer science. We've also built a library of more than 12,000 programming tutorials and more than 1,000 full-length YouTube courses. And most importantly, we've brought together a supportive community of developers who are eager to help people expand their skills. In this brief article and update video, you'll learn about the path ahead, along with some major improvements we're making to freeCodeCamp's core curriculum.</description>

      <description>This week's freeCodeCamp podcast is one of the best interviews I've ever done. Dorian had a rough upbringing in Miami's Little Havana neighborhood. As a kid, he dropped out of high school and got arrested 4 times for crimes like stealing cars. His mother had to get him out of there, and his parole officer agreed to let him move to Las Vegas. There he found stable jobs parking cars at casinos. He taught himself how to code using freeCodeCamp, and eventually got software engineering jobs at Fortune 500 companies. I hope you enjoy this whirlwind of an interview.</description>

      <description>Learn how to leverage the powerful Binary Exponentiation Algorithm to calculate large powers of numbers. Developers use this all the time when working on cryptography and computer graphics. The reason Binary Exponentiation is so powerful is that it reduces the amount of multiplications you need to do, and each iteration through the loop re-uses previous calculations. This tutorial will show you how to implement this algorithm step-by-step with a simple Python script, and understand what's happening under the hood.</description>

Sony then popularized the term in 1994 when they marketed the Playstation's &quot;Geometry Processing Unit&quot;, a Geometry Transformation Engine paired with a 2D co-processor. Finally in 1999, NVIDIA introduced the GeForce 256 &quot;Graphics Processing Unit&quot;, leading to modern GPUs like the one that's in the device that you're reading this Fact of the Week on right now.</description>

      <description>This week on the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview PhD drop-out turned Google Data Scientist Megan Risdal. We talk about how she helps oversee the Kaggle community, which hosts 300,000 open datasets. They also run data science competitions each week that anyone can participate in. We also talk about her time at Stack Overflow, and she compares the two developer communities. Megan studied Applied Linguistics in school, so she has a nuanced perspective on Large Language Models and AI research.</description>

He made up for this by being extremely good at predictive analytics -- honing his instincts for what type of pitch is coming across home plate. I learned this during my insight-filled conversation with Ken Jee. He's a golfer turned data scientist who works closely with professional athletes. During my podcast interview, Ken shares a ton of tips for folks interested in getting into data science and machine learning, and for athletes who want to gain a quantitative edge on their competitors.</description>

      <description>I learned to code in my 30s. I read a bunch of computer science books, built some apps, and won a few hackathons. Then I landed my first software engineering role at a small tech company. I wrote this book to summarize the insights I've heard from CTOs, professors, and fellow self-taught developers. Transitioning into tech is not easy, and it may take you several years of preparation. This book will give you practical, no-nonsense pointers so you can map out your road ahead.</description>

      <description>AI models are more powerful than ever. But most of them are a black box. We don't know why they create the output that they do. And this can be dangerous. Machine Learning researchers call this the problem of Interpretability. Thankfully, a lot of very smart people are hard at work on what's called Explainable AI. This primer by Tiago Monteiro will teach you about Glass Box Models, Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks, and other important concepts in the emerging field of Explainable AI.</description>

      <description>Optimistic UI is a new User Interface Design approach that gets its name from its blind optimism. Instead of waiting for confirmation from the server, an Optimistic UI front-end assumes everything will turn out OK, and immediately updates itself to reflect user input.

This tutorial by developer Jaja David will teach you key concepts like Stale-While-Revalidate and Optimistic CRUD. It will also explore the drawbacks of this happy-go-lucky approach.</description>

      <description>On this week's podcast, I interview Adrian Twarog. He's a software engineer who started his career by working as the office IT guy for 10 years. He's since published YouTube courses that millions of people have watched. We talk about how he learned to code by volunteering to take on web design projects at work. He started making design tutorials on YouTube and published 300 in a single year. And he accomplished all this from Perth, Australia -- as far as you can get from Silicon Valley. I think you'll dig our conversation.</description>

      <description>Two of the most important tools in any data scientist's toolbox are Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. This tutorial by data scientist Olu Samuel Praise will teach you how to apply each of these techniques for analyzing data and making predictions. In short, Logistic Regression will give you a binary classification of data: is this picture of a hot dog -- yes or no? And Linear Regression will give you a continuous value like a percentage. For example, predicting exam scores from students based on their attendance and hours studied. Again, both approaches are super useful and I think you'll learn a lot from this quick read.</description>

      <description>In Machine Learning, Fine-Tuning is the process of taking a model that you've already trained (or a foundation model like Llama) and enhancing it with your own datasets. For example, you could take a Large Language Model and make it much better at chess by fine-tuning it by feeding it thousands of famous chess games. This course will first teach you about Quantization, a technique to optimize models for efficiency. Then you'll learn modern methods of fine-tuning like LORA and QLORA. Next you'll delve into Gradient-based optimization methods. Finally you'll learn how to build AI pipelines and how to fine-tune models using your own datasets.</description>

      <description>On this week's podcast, I interview designer and developer Gary Simon, who is founder of DesignCourse and has over a million YouTube subscribers. I ask him tons of questions about what it takes to become a professional designer in 2024. And we learn all about his own coding journey. He got his start creating thousands of logos for design clients. And he shares the story of how he got complacent mid-career -- right before most of his client work evaporated overnight. He hasn't taken his eye off the ball ever since. It was a blast learning so much from Gary. I think you'll enjoy this, too.</description>

      <description>You may have heard the terms &quot;Microservice&quot; and &quot;Monolith&quot; before. These are two common approaches to architecting an application. You can think of a Monolith as a stand-alone restaurant, and a Microservice as a food stall in a larger food court with shared tables and shared bathrooms. This tutorial will show you the common arguments for building your apps using each of these architectures. It will also walk you common configurations using lots of helpful diagrams.</description>

      <description>On this week's freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview 100Devs founder Leon Noel. Growing up, Leon felt he needed to become a doctor in order to be considered successful. But his interest in coding inspired him to drop out of Yale and build software tools for scientists. He went through a startup accelerator, taught coding in his community, and ultimately built a Discord server with 60,000 people learning to code together. We talk about the science behind learning, and what approaches have helped his students the most. We even talk about Jazz pianist Thelonious Monk, and Leon's love of the animated X-Men show.</description>

She's worked as a software engineer for more than a decade at companies like GitHub and Glitch. Among her many accomplishments, she created the Electron team at GitHub. Electron is a library for building desktop apps using browser technologies. If you've used the desktop version of Slack, Figma, or VS Code, you've used Electron. We had such a fun time talking about her journey from architecture student to city hall to working at the highest levels of tech.</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp just published a massive TypeScript course to help you learn the art of statically-typed JavaScript. Most scripting languages like JavaScript and Python are dynamically-typed. But this causes so many additional coding errors. By sticking with static types -- like Java and C++ do -- JavaScript developers can save so much headache. This beginner course is taught by legendary coding instructor John Smilga. I love his no-nonsense teaching style and the way he makes even advanced concepts easier to understand. And you can apply what you're learning by coding along at home and building your own ecommerce platform project in TypeScript.</description>

      <description>How can two people communicate securely through an insecure channel? That is a fundamental challenge in cryptography. One approach is by using the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange algorithm. freeCodeCamp just published a handbook that will teach you how to leverage Diffie-Hellman to protect your data in transit, as it moves from between clients and servers. This handbook dives deep into the math that makes this possible, and uses tons of diagrams to explain the theory. It also explores older solutions, such as Hash-based Message Authentication Code. And you'll immediately put all this new knowledge to use by building a secure messaging project.</description>

      <description>The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a big Christmas tree that you hang ornament-like HTML elements on. This front-end development handbook will teach you how the DOM works, and how you can use it to make interactive web pages. You'll learn about DOM Traversal, Class Manipulation, Event Bubbling, and other key concepts.</description>

      <description>On this week's episode of the freeCodeCamp Podcast, I interview Jessica Wilkins, an orchestral musician from Los Angeles turned software engineer. We talk about how ridiculously competitive the world of classical music is, and how it gave her the mental toughness that she needed to learn to code. Jessica ultimately turned down contracts from Disney and other music industry titans so that she could focus on transitioning into tech. She was a prolific volunteer contributor to the freeCodeCamp codebase and core curriculum, and now works on our team. I think you'll dig our conversation -- especially if you're interested in the overlap between music and technology.</description>

      <description>It's hard to predict the exact order in which things will happen in life. That's certainly the case in software. Thankfully, developers have pioneered a more flexible approach called Asynchronous Programming. And JavaScript is especially well-equipped for async programming thanks to its special Promise objects. freeCodeCamp just published this JavaScript Promises handbook to teach you common async patterns. You'll also learn about error handling, promise chaining, and async anti-patterns to avoid.</description>

      <description>A String is one of the most primordial of data types. You can find String variables in almost every programming language. Strings are just a sequence of characters, usually between two quote marks, like this: &quot;banana&quot;. And yet there are so many things you can do with Strings: Concatenation, Comparison, Encoding, and even String Searching with Regular Expressions. Joan Ayebola wrote this in-depth handbook that will teach you everything you need to know about JavaScript Strings.</description>

      <description>Joke of the Week: *&quot;Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Dec 25 = Oct 31.&quot;* In programming, Dec stands for Decimal, meaning a base-10 number system. And Oct stands for Octal, meaning a base-8 number system. So Dec 25 really does equal Oct 31. I know – this isn't the funniest programmer joke ever, but it is fun to think about.</description>

      <description>Developers sometimes encode data as raw text using Base64, even though it takes up 33% more storage than binary. Why do they do this? Well, Base64 is just a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and two symbols: + and /. Just to check my math, that's 26 + 26 + 10 + 2 = 64 characters, right? This tutorial will teach you all the things you never knew you wanted to know about Base64. And it will solve the mystery of why developers continue to use this even today.</description>

      <description>VS Code is a powerful code editor used by pretty much every developer on freeCodeCamp's team, and most of the other developers I know, too. But much of its power is non-obvious. So freeCodeCamp published this comprehensive beginner-to-advanced VS Code course. It will help you navigate VS Code's Command Palette, customized themes, keyboard shortcuts, and its library of extensions for React, GitHub, and more.</description>

      <description>The 0/1 Knapsack Problem is an iconic optimization problem in computer science. Let's say you're in a hurry, and you need to pack your belongings into a knapsack that you can take with you. How do you maximize the value of your belongings given that you can only carry a certain amount of weight? To solve this problem, we're going to use C# and a coding approach called Dynamic Programming. freeCodeCamp instructor Gavin Lon teaches this course, and he even plays some electric guitar in the video. I think you'll dig it and learn a lot.</description>

You'll learn about vector embeddings and how you can use them on top of GPT-4 and other Large Language Models. This way you can code your own AI assistant with output customized by you. For example, you can throw all 11,000 tutorials freeCodeCamp has published into a database, embed them, and then your AI assistant can retrieve relevant tutorials when you ask it a question. This may sound pretty advanced, but modern tools make this a lot easier. You'll learn how to use OpenAI's GPT-4 API, LangChain, data from Hugging Face, and age-old Natural Language Processing techniques.</description>

      <description>Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complicated problems by breaking them down into smaller bits. You then store the solutions to these sub-problems in a table, where they can be more efficiently accessed, so the computer doesn't need to recalculate them each time. This efficient DP approach comes up all the time in Algorithms &amp; Data Structure coding interview questions. And this freeCodeCamp course will teach you how to ace those questions. We teach DP using Java. But if you know Python, C++, or JavaScript, you may be able to follow along as well.</description>

      <description>20 years ago, a few developers sat down to catalog the most common security issues they were discovering on the web. And from that, the OWASP Top 10 emerged as a popular reference for devs. You can use OWASP as a checklist to ensure a baseline level of security in your apps. This course will teach you how to spot these common pitfalls and avoid them in your projects.</description>

      <description>I'm going to attempt to explain 3 types of cloud storage in this single paragraph. Block Storage is like a book shelf that can hold a set number of pages -- say 100. A 200 page book would take up 2 shelves. File Storage then adds abstractions on top of that, such as directories and hierarchy. Finally, Object Storage is the newest, most durable approach. It just uses flat files. And I'm just scratching the surface here. You should totally read more in Daniel's thoughtful tutorial.</description>

      <description>Finally, I'm excited to share that after a 4 year break, I've relaunched the freeCodeCamp Podcast. I spent several weeks in San Francisco interviewing developers in-person at public libraries across the city. And this week I'm heading to New York City to interview even more devs. I'll publish a new interview each week. The first 3 interviews are already live. (3 new 2-hour episodes + 85 older episodes): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/freecodecamp-podcast-season-2-developer-interviews/</description>

      <description>TypeScript is a popular version of JavaScript that uses static types. This means that for each variable in your code, you specify whether it's a string, array, integer, or other data type. Why bother with this? Because it will dramatically reduce the number of bugs in your codebase. freeCodeCamp moved to TypeScript a few years ago, and we haven't looked back. If you know some basic JavaScript, you can quickly learn TypeScript and start reaping the benefits. This full-length handbook will teach you how to use React with TypeScript. You can code along at home and build your own type-safe To Do List app.</description>

      <description>C is the most widely-used programming language in the world. Even when you're coding in Python or JavaScript, you're still using C under the hood. One key reason why C is still so popular 50 years after its creation is its high performance. C directly interacts with computer hardware. One way it does this is through Pointers, which point to the location of data in the computer's physical memory. In this beginner's freeCodeCamp course on C programming, you'll learn about Pointers and key concepts like Passing By Reference, Passing By Value, Void Pointers, Arrays, and more.</description>

      <description>One of the most critical concepts you should understand about Git is Branching. We've got you covered. In this tutorial, Deborah Kurata will teach you how to create a local Git repository with a main branch, then branch off of it. She'll show you how to commit your code changes, then merge those files back into the main branch. This is what I like to call the &quot;core gameplay loop&quot; of software development. Enjoy.</description>

      <description>You may have heard about AIs that can beat the world's best Chess players, Go players, and even Starcraft players. Many of these AIs use a game-playing algorithm called AlphaZero. The AI starts out by playing a game against itself to learn the rules and discover strategies. After a few hours of training, it's often able to play the game at a superhuman level. This Python course will teach you how to code your own AlphaZero algorithm from scratch that can win at both Tic Tac Toe and Connect 4. You'll learn about Monte Carlo Tree Search, Neural Networks, and more. This is an ideal course for anyone who wants to learn more about Machine Learning.</description>

      <description>In the age of Netflix and League of Legends, there are plenty of things to keep you from achieving your goals. But don't let a lack of learning resources be one of them. My friend Dhawal compiled an in-depth guide to more than 850 Ivy League university courses that are now freely available online. One of the very best things about the internet: it has made it possible for anyone with an internet connection to learn from world-class professors. I hope some of these courses help you push forward toward your learning goals.</description>

      <description>The ‘joy of discovery' is one of the fundamental joys of play itself. Not just the joy of discovering secrets within the game, but also the joy of uncovering the creator's vision. It's that ‘Aha!' moment where it all makes sense, and behind the world the player can feel the touch of another creative mind. In order for it to be truly joyful, however, it must remain hidden from plain view-not carved as commandments into stone tablets but revealed, piece by piece, through the player's exploration of the game's rules. - Derek Yu, game developer and creator of Spelunky</description>

      <description>freeCodeCamp just published a course that will teach you how to code your own API using Python. APIs are like websites designed for other computers to understand, rather than humans. Instead of sharing text, images, videos -- and other media that humans understand -- APIs just share raw data, such as JSON responses. This course will show you how to build your own REST API using the popular Python Django REST framework.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered why we write it &quot;freeCodeCamp&quot; with a lowercase f? That's because we thought it would be funny to use Camel Case like JavaScript does for its variables. And this is just one style of cases that developers use. This guide will introduce you to other popular styles of writing variable names, including Snake Case, Pascal Case, and even Kebab Case.</description>

      <description>TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript.</description>

      <description>User Interface VS User Experience -- what's the difference, you might ask? Well, User Interfaces have been around since the industrial revolution. Think the control room of a power station, or the cockpit of a plane. But User Experience -- that's a more recent way of thinking about Human-Computer Interaction. The term was coined in the 1990s by a designer and cognitive psychologist at Apple. This tutorial by freeCodeCamp instructor Dionysia Lemonaki will explain the distinctions between the two and their shared history. She'll also walk you through the UX Design Process.</description>

      <description>Without computer networks, I'd need to put on my sneakers and run this letter to your door. Or bankrupt our charity buying postage stamps. Over the past 30 years, networks have changed almost everything about talking, learning, and getting things done. They are worthy of your attention and your respect. So learn a bit more about how they work. This tutorial will walk you through 5 of the most important layers -- from the physical hardware all the way up to the applications running on top of all that sweet, sweet abstraction.</description>

      <description>In C, there's no magic. If you want something to be somewhere in memory, you have to put it there yourself. If you want a hash table, you have to implement it yourself.

      <description>CSS is a programming language. As unintuitive as it might feel to you at times, it's not just these random things that happen. It's built using very specific rules. The problem is that most people never learn those rules. We start learning CSS by learning the syntax, which is super simple. That tricks us into thinking that it's a simple language. Don't let the simple syntax trick you. Dive into it and learn how it works. - Kevin Powell, Software Engineer, CSS Educator, and freeCodeCamp contributor</description>

      <description>What is abstraction? And why is it useful in programming? In this tutorial, Tiago will explain how developers use abstraction, through the analogy of learning to drive a car. For example, you don't need to know how a braking system works -- you just need to know that when you stomp on the brake, the car slows to a stop. The exact mechanisms can be abstracted away from the user interface (the brake pedal).</description>

      <description>Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the &quot;locally optimal&quot; solution at each stage of problem solving -- regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward -- never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum -- the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide &amp; Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them.</description>

      <description>The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove' to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample. This delay imparts a very ‘lazy', dragging feel on any beat using the bass drum - and the lower the pitch the greater the drag. - A fun fact from the music production-focused Attack Magazine</description>

      <description>Fact of the Week: During the production of the movie Toy Story 2, an unnamed Pixar employee was doing some routine data cleanup. They wanted to delete some of their files. So they typed this into their command line: bin/rm -r -f \*. But they didn't realize that they were running the command inside the server's root folder. Animators knew something was wrong when the files they were working on started vanishing. They rushed over and unplugged the computer. But it was too late. 90% of the Toy Story 2's files had been deleted. The team was going to have to completely restart the $100,000,000 project. Luckily, one of their animators was working from home after having a baby. She had a 2-week old backup of the data sitting on her desk. After she carefully drove her computer to the office, they were able to restore the database.</description>

      <description>When you visit a website like freeCodeCamp.org, your computer starts sending packets of data back and forth across the internet using the Internet Protocol. The IPv4 protocol came out way back in 1980, and gives every server its own 4-byte address. (That's 4 numbers between 0 and 255. For example, the localhost address: 127.0.0.1). But this only results in 4.3 billion possible combinations. And websites are already using almost all of these. Thankfully, the newer IPv6 protocol can save humanity from the threat of &quot;address exhaustion&quot;. This article will show you how IPv6 works.</description>

Assume your adversaries are better than they are. Assume science and technology will soon be able to do things they cannot yet. Give yourself a margin for error. Give yourself more security than you need today. When the unexpected happens, you'll be glad you did. - Bruce Schneier, Security Researcher</description>

      <description>Every year developers hold a competition to build video games using just 13 kilobytes of JavaScript. For reference, the original Donkey Kong game from 1981 was 16 kilobytes. And yet these devs are able to build platformers, puzzle games, and even 3D games in just 13KB. In this video, Ania will demo the top 20 games from the 2020 js13k competition, and she'll explain some of the techniques developers used to code these games.</description>
