1. Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the “locally optimal” solution at each stage of problem solving – regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward – never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum – the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-greedy-algorithms/

Quote of the Week: *"The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove’ to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample. This delay imparts a very ‘lazy’, dragging feel on any beat using the bass drum – and the lower the pitch the greater the drag."* — A fun fact from the music production-focused Attack Magazine

Fact of the Week: During the production of the movie Toy Story 2, an unnamed Pixar employee was doing some routine data cleanup. They wanted to delete some of their files. So they typed this into their command line: bin/rm -r -f \*. But they didn't realize that they were running the command inside the server's root folder. Animators knew something was wrong when the files they were working on started vanishing. They rushed over and unplugged the computer. But it was too late. 90% of the Toy Story 2's files had been deleted. The team was going to have to completely restart the $100,000,000 project. Luckily, one of their animators was working from home after having a baby. She had a 2-week old backup of the data sitting on her desk.
