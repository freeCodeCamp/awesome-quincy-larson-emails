1. Quantum Computing is real. Engineers are already finding ways to apply it to Cryptography, Drug Discovery, AI, and other fields. You can be the first of your friends to understand and appreciate how Quantum Computing works. The first half of this course focuses on the math behind quantum computing algorithms. You'll learn about Complex Numbers and Linear Algebra. Then you'll learn concepts like Qubits – Quantum Bits – along with Quantum Entanglement, Quantum Circuits, and Phase Kickback. Even though this course is designed for newcomers to Quantum Computing, I'm not going to downplay the importance of math skills in understanding this course. Fortunately, if you want to improve your math skills, freeCodeCamp also has a ton of university-level math courses to help get you there.

Joke of the Week: A cop pulls Werner Heisenberg over and asks him: *"Do you have any idea how fast you were driving?"*

Heisenberg replies: *"No. But I DO know exactly where I am right now."*

The cop, exasperated, says: *"You were driving 100 miles per hour!"*

And Heisenberg sighs and says: *"Welp. Now I'm totally lost."*

That was a joke I heard from a physics teacher. My quick, dirty, non-physics teacher explanation: the Heisenberg Uncertainty principle in Quantum Mechanics essentially states that you can't – at the same time – accurately know both the momentum of a particle and that particle's location.

Quote of the Week: *"I think that in life, as in game design, you have to find the fun. There is joy out there waiting to be discovered, but it might not be where you expected.

You can’t decide what something’s going to be before you embark on it, and you shouldn’t stick with a bad idea just because you’re fond of it. Take action as quickly and repeatedly as possible. Take advantage of what you already know. And take liberties with tradition.

But most importantly, take the time to appreciate the possibilities, and make sure all of your decisions are interesting ones."* — Sid Meier, game developer and creator of the Civilization game series

Fact of the Week: As abstract as Algebra may seem, it was invented to solve the practical math problems of the 9th Century. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was an astronomer in Baghdad. He wanted to figure out fair ways to distribute land, salaries, and inheritance.

In the process, he invented Algebra, which comes from the Arabic word al-jabr – roughly translating to "reunion of broken parts." In his book "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" he described methods for reducing and then balancing equations – a task every student of math can now enjoy.

Also fun fact: the word Algorithm comes from a Latinization of al-Khwarizmi's name.

Quote of the Week: *"The ‘joy of discovery’ is one of the fundamental joys of play itself. Not just the joy of discovering secrets within the game, but also the joy of uncovering the creator’s vision. It’s that ‘Aha!’ moment where it all makes sense, and behind the world the player can feel the touch of another creative mind. In order for it to be truly joyful, however, it must remain hidden from plain view—not carved as commandments into stone tablets but revealed, piece by piece, through the player’s exploration of the game’s rules."* — Derek Yu, game developer and creator of Spelunky

1. Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the “locally optimal” solution at each stage of problem solving – regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward – never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum – the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming.

Quote of the Week: *"The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove’ to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample.

Fact of the Week: During the production of the movie Toy Story 2, an unnamed Pixar employee was doing some routine data cleanup. They wanted to delete some of their files. So they typed this into their command line: bin/rm -r -f \*. But they didn't realize that they were running the command inside the server's root folder. Animators knew something was wrong when the files they were working on started vanishing. They rushed over and unplugged the computer. But it was too late. 90% of the Toy Story 2's files had been deleted. The team was going to have to completely restart the $100,000,000 project. Luckily, one of their animators was working from home after having a baby. She had a 2-week old backup of the data sitting on her desk.
