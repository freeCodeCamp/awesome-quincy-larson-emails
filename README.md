1. TypeScript is a popular version of JavaScript that uses static types. This means that for each variable in your code, you specify whether it's a string, array, integer, or other data type. Why bother with this? Because it will dramatically reduce the number of bugs in your codebase. freeCodeCamp moved to TypeScript a few years ago, and we haven't looked back. If you know some basic JavaScript, you can quickly learn TypeScript and start reaping the benefits. This full-length handbook will teach you how to use React with TypeScript. You can code along at home and build your own type-safe To Do List app. (full-length handbook – 2 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/typescript-tutorial-for-react-developers/

2. We also published a full-length book on Astro. It's a popular new User Interface framework that a lot of my friends are adopting. Astro is written in TypeScript, and built for speed. This book is structured as a series of projects. You can code along at home and build your own Component Island, then build React apps on top of it. Along the way, you'll get a feel for Server-Side Rendering. (full-length book - 8 hour read): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-the-astro-ui-framework/

3. Steganography is the art of hiding things in plain sight. It translates to “the study of hidden things” in Greek. You can hide data inside of other data. Then – if you did it right – people will be none the wiser. This tutorial will show you how to use Steganography to hide information in text, images, video, and even network traffic itself.

Quote of the Week: *"I think that in life, as in game design, you have to find the fun. There is joy out there waiting to be discovered, but it might not be where you expected.

You can’t decide what something’s going to be before you embark on it, and you shouldn’t stick with a bad idea just because you’re fond of it. Take action as quickly and repeatedly as possible. Take advantage of what you already know. And take liberties with tradition.

But most importantly, take the time to appreciate the possibilities, and make sure all of your decisions are interesting ones."* — Sid Meier, game developer and creator of the Civilization game series

Fact of the Week: As abstract as Algebra may seem, it was invented to solve the practical math problems of the 9th Century. Muhammad ibn Musa al-Khwarizmi was an astronomer in Baghdad. He wanted to figure out fair ways to distribute land, salaries, and inheritance.

In the process, he invented Algebra, which comes from the Arabic word al-jabr – roughly translating to "reunion of broken parts." In his book "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing" he described methods for reducing and then balancing equations – a task every student of math can now enjoy.

Also fun fact: the word Algorithm comes from a Latinization of al-Khwarizmi's name.

Quote of the Week: *"The ‘joy of discovery’ is one of the fundamental joys of play itself. Not just the joy of discovering secrets within the game, but also the joy of uncovering the creator’s vision. It’s that ‘Aha!’ moment where it all makes sense, and behind the world the player can feel the touch of another creative mind. In order for it to be truly joyful, however, it must remain hidden from plain view—not carved as commandments into stone tablets but revealed, piece by piece, through the player’s exploration of the game’s rules."* — Derek Yu, game developer and creator of Spelunky

1. freeCodeCamp just published a hands-on Microservice Architecture course. This is a great way to learn about Distributed Systems. You can code along at home, and build your own video-to-MP3 file converter app. Along the way, you'll learn some MongoDB, Kubernetes, and MySQL.

2. TypeScript is like JavaScript, but with static types. For each variable, you specify whether it's a string, integer, boolean, or other data type. If you already know some JavaScript, TypeScript may not take that much time to learn. And it can reduce the number of bugs in your code. freeCodeCamp has converted almost our entire codebase to use TypeScript. It still has all the power of JavaScript, but it's now a bit easier for us to build new features. This beginner course will teach you everything you need to get started coding TypeScript.

1. Greedy Algorithms are a powerful approach to solving coding challenges. These work by always choosing the “locally optimal” solution at each stage of problem solving – regardless of the long-term consequences. For example, let's say I'm hiking in the mountains, and my goal is to reach as high an elevation as possible. I take the quick-and-dirty Greedy Algorithm approach of always hiking upward – never downward. At some point I will reach a local maximum – the highest point I can reach. And from that hill I will probably look over and see much taller mountains that I could have reached if I used a different algorithmic approach, such as Divide & Conquer or Dynamic Programming. This course will teach you how to code Greedy Algorithms in Python, and when to best make use of them. (2 hour YouTube course): https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-greedy-algorithms/

Quote of the Week: *"The Oberheim DMX [drum machine], released in 1981, featured separate voice boards for each sound, where the tuning would alter sample playback rate. Over the years, many people attributed a particular kind of ‘groove’ to the DMX. After much investigation, I discovered that this is just a by-product of the original factory bass drum sound containing a small amount of silence at the very start of the sample. This delay imparts a very ‘lazy’, dragging feel on any beat using the bass drum – and the lower the pitch the greater the drag."* — A fun fact from the music production-focused Attack Magazine

Fact of the Week: During the production of the movie Toy Story 2, an unnamed Pixar employee was doing some routine data cleanup. They wanted to delete some of their files. So they typed this into their command line: bin/rm -r -f \*. But they didn't realize that they were running the command inside the server's root folder. Animators knew something was wrong when the files they were working on started vanishing. They rushed over and unplugged the computer. But it was too late. 90% of the Toy Story 2's files had been deleted. The team was going to have to completely restart the $100,000,000 project. Luckily, one of their animators was working from home after having a baby. She had a 2-week old backup of the data sitting on her desk. After she carefully drove her computer to the office, they were able to restore the database.
